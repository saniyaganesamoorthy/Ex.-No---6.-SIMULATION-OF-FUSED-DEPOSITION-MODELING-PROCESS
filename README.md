# Ex. No. 6 - SIMULATION OF FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING PROCESS

## DATE:27/11/2023 
## AIM:
### To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
### STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
### STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
### STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
### STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
### STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.

# EXPLANATION :  
In a 3D printer diagram ,the X and Y axes control
Lateral movement , the foam base provide support , the build platform holds the object being printed , and the Z axis manages
Vertical movement , enabling layer-by-layer construction.
# Step 2:

# EXPLANATION : 
The X and Y axes dictate horizontal movement , while the Z axis controls vertical motion in a 3D printer . The extrusion head with an extrusion nozzle deposits material layer by layer onto the build platform atop the foam base, forming the printing object.

# EXPLANATION:
In a 3D printer the X and Y axes control horizontal movement , while the Z axis manages vertical positioning. The extrusion head with an extrusion nozzle deposits material layer by layer onto the build platform, supported by a foam base, and is supplied by a build material spool.

# EXPLANATION:
The X and Y axes govern lateral movement , and the Z axis controls vertical positioning in a 3D printer. The build material , fed from a spool, is extruded through an extrusion head with a nozzle onto the build platform situated on a foam base.

# EXPLANATION: 
The X and Y axes control horizontal movement , and the Z axis manages vertical positioning in a 3D printer . Filament from a build material spool is extruded through an extrusion head with a nozzle onto the build platform, situated on a foam base.

# EXPLANATION: 
The X and Y axes guide lateral movement , and the Z axis controls vertical positioning in a 3D printer . Filament from a build material spool is extruded through an extrusion head with a nozzle to create a layered part on the platform, situated on a foam base.
